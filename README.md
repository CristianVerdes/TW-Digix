# TW-Digix
This project was made in 2016 at Web Technologies class.
Is a web-site that connects to Google Plus and Facebook and collects all pictures, videos and files from Gooogle Drive.
The idea is that you can store anything that has sentimental value to you in one place and search the content you want like:
"Videos with my grandma in 2016", "Pictures with my friend Andrei", "Pictures when I was in highschool" and so on.
